## Loot4Everyone revamps loot chests so every player can have his own loot and let you create, edit, delete, reset ANY loot chests!

### _⚠️ Warning ⚠️_

### _If you have loot chests that are already generated, you can regenerate them with **/generatelc** to add them in the system._

 

### Features

*   Know when you discover for the first time a loot chest! A message appear with a sound effect and you can have information about what's inside the loot chest!
*   Loot chest griefing protection! Config it with **/setbreakrule <value>** (**true** or **false**)
*   Random loot for every player! Config it with **/setrandomrule <value>** (**true** or **false**)
*   Reset loot chests! Look at a loot chest and do **/resetlc** to reset this chest for all players or specify the player by adding the arg **\--player <name>** and/or the arg **\--all true** to reset all loot chests for the player provided with the arg or else for all players.
*   Loot chest maker system! Create, edit, delete ANY loot chests!

### Loot chest maker

*   To select a loot chest or an item container, just look at it!
*   Use any item container to generate a loot chest! With just **/generatelc** you generate automatically a loot chest based on the zone! You can add the arg **\--droplist <droplist-id>** to specify ANY droplist that your server has access (yes this should work with modded droplists!). If you prefer to make a custom droplist add items inside of the item container and just do **/generatelc** to have your custom loot chest!
*   Edit any loot chest! You can do **/editlc** **\--droplist <droplist-id>** to change the droplist of the chest! You can also just do **/editlc** with custom loot chests to edit the items of your own droplist and after that just do **/generatelc** to confirm the changes.
*   Delete any loot chest with **/deletelc**!

### Roadmap

*   It's empty...it's up to you to send a suggestion!

#### **This mod is fully released but game updates can break the mod, so always check the mod description before a major update of the game and never use it in a pre-release unless i say you can do it!**

#### **If you find bugs feel free to report them or help me fix them if you want!**

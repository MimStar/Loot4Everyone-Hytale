Loot4Everyone is a mod that instantiate loot chests for every player like lootr or Loot4Everyone minecraft mods.  
Only **new** generated loot chests can be detected by the system, it's better if you use my mod in a new world! But you can still use it in your current world and generate new chunks!

 

By default you can't break loot chests! But you can use the command **/setbreakrule <value>** (**true** of **false**) to change the value of the break loot chests rule. (False=can't break, True=can break).

 

Currently my mod don't work with:

*   Double chests (if you're not adding modded double loot chests you should be fine!)

 

Currently i'm working on these features:

*   Generating your own loot chests by putting items in it and activating with a command

#### **This mod is in beta state, game updates can break the mod and not all the features i want are added but the mod is stable and has a solid foundation of features!** 

#### **If you find bugs feel free to report them or help me fix them if you want!**
